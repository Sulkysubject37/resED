\title{\textbf{Reliability is a System Property:}\\Formal Methodology and Empirical Validation of the resED Architecture}

\begin{abstract}
This report formalizes the methodology, experimental protocol, and results of the \textbf{resED} (Reliability-First Encoder-Decoder) project. We demonstrate that component-level reliability is unattainable in high-dimensional generative models due to intrinsic volatility. Instead, reliability must be engineered as a \textit{system property} through external governance. We define the mathematical foundations of the Representation-Level Control Surface (RLCS), present empirical failure envelopes for core components, and verify the system's ability to detect and mitigate failure modes across synthetic, vision, and biological domains without retraining.
