\section{Interpretation and Synthesis}

\subsection{Reliability as a System Property}
The central thesis of this work is that reliability in generative models is an emergent property of the \textbf{system architecture}, not an intrinsic attribute of the model parameters. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Opacity vs. Control}: Deep learning modules are opaque black boxes. By wrapping them in a transparent, deterministic control surface, we convert this opacity into observability. 
    \item \textbf{Decoupled Validation}: Generation (Encoder/Decoder) and Validation (RLCS) are orthogonal. This prevents the "confidently wrong" syndrome common in robust-training methods, where models learn to satisfy the loss function without actually being safe.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Observability and Governance over Robustness}
Conventional AI research focuses on increasing model robustness---making components fail less often. resED assumes components \textit{will} fail and focuses on making those failures \textbf{observable} and \textbf{governable}. This shift from "fixing the model" to "controlling the system" enables reliable deployment even when components are volatile.

\subsection{The Role of Structural Calibration}
The calibration layer proves that "trust" is a relative concept. A distance of 10.0 might be a massive outlier in a 2D space but perfectly normal in 100D. Reference-conditioned calibration provides the semantic bridge necessary for domain-agnostic reliability. It transforms geometric raw distances into a universal language of risk (Z-scores), allowing the system to operate consistently across Vision and Biology.

\subsection{Formal Synthesis}
We define a reliable system $\mathcal{R}$ not as one that maximizes accuracy, but as one that bounds its operational envelope $\mathcal{O}$ within the validated support of its reference population $\mathcal{P}$:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{R}_{system} \subseteq \mathcal{O}(z) \text{ s.t. } P(z | \mathcal{P}) > \tau
\end{equation}
The resED architecture empirically satisfies this definition by enforcing the inequality $\hat{D}(z) \le q_\alpha$ before any generation occurs.
