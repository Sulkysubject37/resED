\section{Introduction}

The deployment of deep learning models in safety-critical domains is often hindered by their opacity and intrinsic volatility. Despite achieving high performance on in-distribution benchmarks, neural networks can fail catastrophically when exposed to distributional shifts, producing "hallucinations" that are semantically plausible but factually incorrect. Current research largely focuses on making these models more robust---optimizing parameters to minimize failure rates. However, we argue that component-level robustness is an insufficient goal for high-stakes systems.

\subsection{Reliability as a System Property}
We propose that reliability should be engineered as a \textit{system property}, not a component attribute. In this work, a "system" is defined as a composite of independent \textit{generators} (opaque learned models) and \textit{regulators} (transparent governance logic). This distinction mirrors biological regulation: cellular systems do not rely on error-free DNA replication; instead, they employ rigorous checkpoints (e.g., the p53 pathway) to detect and arrest propagation of errors. Similarly, AI systems must assume that learned components will fail and provide mechanisms to detect and mitigate these failures at the system level.

\subsection{The Necessity of External Governance}
Learned components are fundamentally opaque. Their internal confidence metrics (logits, probabilities) are often overconfident on anomalous inputs. Therefore, governance must be external and deterministic. By monitoring the latent representation---the information bottleneck of the system---we can enforce statistical invariants that serve as a proxy for semantic validity.

\subsection{Contributions}
This paper introduces the \textbf{resED} (Representation-Gated Encoder--Decoder) framework. Our specific contributions are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{System-Level Governance Architecture}: We define a modular architecture where generative components are strictly gated by a Representation-Level Control Surface (RLCS).
    \item \textbf{Representation-Level Observability}: We introduce non-parametric sensors (ResLik, TCS) that convert latent geometry into observable risk scores.
    \item \textbf{Reference-Conditioned Calibration}: We demonstrate a structural calibration method that normalizes risk scores across diverse domains (Vision and Biology).
    \item \textbf{Empirical Validation of Governance}: We show that the governed system suppresses 100\% of high-magnitude failures across diverse benchmarks (e.g., CIFAR-10 \cite{Krizhevsky09learningmultiple}) while maintaining >99\% acceptance of valid data, a result unachievable by the ungoverned components alone.
